A code for computing pair distribution curves of given anion and cations

usage: ./this_code -O 1 -Si 2 -Al 3 -P 6 -Na 7 -SiO 2.0 -AlO 2.25 -PO 2.5 -NaO 2.6

NOTE: please give some random values for each cation and anion pair distances in the command line, however, it will not influence the pair distribution. 
The g(r) is not yet notmalized so it needs to be normalized
